  title: LLMs increases coverage not efficiency
  domain: artificial_intelligence
  hypothesis: 'Large Language Models (LLMs) do not significantly increase task efficiency
    or improve the quality of outputs, but instead increase the coverage of possible
    approaches by enabling users to try many more options rapidly. This leads to greater
    exploration and sensitivity to final choices, and raises the lower bound of output
    quality in areas where LLMs can match or exceed previous human performance.

    '
  background:
    description: 'LLMs likely don''t help you complete tasks that much more efficiently.
      There''s already plenty of work done about work slop and whether what people
      are producing with LLMs is better and it largely seems like it isn''t. Instead,
      LLMs allow you to try a lot more things a lot more rapidly. That in itself is
      measurable. I also think that there will be two major byproducts from this state
      of affairs, if it''s true. One is that people will try many more things before
      deciding on one approach, when assisted by an LLM, resulting  in more sensitivity
      to final form than previously. If you can have an LLM give you a hundred different
      titles for your paper, you will play around more (this is in direct opposition
      to the homogenization thesis). 2. is that the lower bound of what people will
      do will rise in many areas where an LLM could do something at least as good
      as a human used to be able to on its own and therefore or to seem unique, you''ll
      have to try a lot harder.
