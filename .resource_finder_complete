RESOURCE FINDING PHASE COMPLETED
========================================

Timestamp: $(date -Iseconds)
Date: November 23, 2025

SUMMARY:
--------
Resource finding phase completed successfully for the research project:
"LLMs increases coverage not efficiency"

RESOURCES GATHERED:
-------------------
Papers downloaded: 8
  - Systematic reviews: 1
  - Empirical studies: 4
  - Surveys: 2
  - Benchmark analyses: 1

Datasets downloaded: 2
  - HumanEval: 164 hand-crafted programming problems
  - MBPP: 974 crowd-sourced Python problems

Code repositories cloned: 2
  - OpenAI human-eval: Official evaluation framework
  - Google MBPP: Dataset files and documentation

DELIVERABLES:
-------------
✓ papers/ directory with 8 PDFs (11 MB)
✓ papers/README.md documenting all papers
✓ datasets/ directory with HumanEval and MBPP (~7 MB)
✓ datasets/.gitignore to exclude data files from git
✓ datasets/README.md with download instructions
✓ datasets/download_datasets.py for reproducibility
✓ code/ directory with evaluation frameworks
✓ code/README.md documenting repositories
✓ literature_review.md (comprehensive 24KB review)
✓ resources.md (complete resource catalog)

KEY FINDINGS FROM LITERATURE:
------------------------------
1. Primary LLM use is exploration (71.9% for understanding)
2. Energy efficiency 1.17-2x worse than human code
3. Task completion 55.8% faster but quality concerns
4. Productivity gains inconsistent and task-dependent
5. Pass@k metrics show success through multiple attempts

RECOMMENDED EXPERIMENTS:
------------------------
1. Measure pass@k for k ∈ {1, 5, 10, 50, 100}
2. Compare energy efficiency to canonical solutions
3. Analyze solution diversity (coverage indicator)
4. Measure code quality with multiple metrics
5. Test task complexity interactions

NEXT PHASE:
-----------
The experiment runner can now:
- Use HumanEval and MBPP datasets (locally available)
- Implement evaluation using human-eval framework
- Apply insights from 8 reviewed papers
- Test hypothesis with comprehensive metrics

All resources documented and ready for experimentation.
